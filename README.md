# Abstract
In this project, we utilized multiple pre-trained image classification models, namely ResNet18, VGG16, and InceptionV3, to solve a multilabel classification problem. We trained these models in two ways: binary classification and multilabel classification.

To improve the models' performance, we conducted parameter tuning with a total of 14 trials. We experimented with different hyperparameter configurations and saved the logs for each trial to analyze the results.

The best-performing model, **inceptionV3, achieved an accuracy of 0.96**, and through parameter tuning and utilizing multiple pre-trained models, we aimed to further enhance the models' accuracy and overall performance.
